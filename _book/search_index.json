This will be used to select the desired displays from the monitors within the room. All monitors are labelled from A to D with an indication as to what output is being shown. There is also a remote control which can change outputs should you wish to use this when recording. Figure 2.1: HDMI Matrix with instructions on channel connections Pull down the black curtain if you are recording. A yellow pulley is adjacent to the left-side wall which will lower the curtain. Figure 2.2: Pulley for curtain Switch on all of the lights here for recording. The switches for these are marked at the sockets around the room and shown below. Switch on the lightboard lights also if you intend to use this. The main room lights can be switched off (and will do automatically within 10 minutes as they are on a timer). Some of the lights are movable and feel free to adjust these as you wish for your recording.

Log in using the BOLD account (password – glasgow). Switch on the camera for recording. Ensure the SD card is inserted prior to recording. The SD card can be accessed at the bottom of the camera. Figure 2.4: Camera setup for recording Ensure there is enough space on the SD card before you begin to record. You can check this by inserting the SD card into the D-link port behind the Mac. Figure 2.5: D-link port to connect SD card Switch on microphone pack. When wearing the pack, it is best to clip this on your side facing up, hiding the cable inside your top and attaching the mic to your collar. Also switch on the remote pack beside the camera. You can test that this is working by looking at the display and seeing the volume going up and down on the camera. Figure 2.6: Microphone pack for recording with camera pack If neither pack is switching on, replace the batteries for these using the rechargeable batteries near the Mac. Be sure to charge any flat batteries. There are spare charged batteries in the cabinet in the right corner behind the Mac. Figure 2.7: Battery charger Switch on the monitors. There is one Samsung remote which can be used to switch on all of the displays. Keep the remote close to the front of the display when switching on so this is picked up by the receiver.

If you are just recording yourself with no slides or using the whiteboard, you can skip the following steps and record directly off the camera. To set up the second recording with the screen capture, first prepare your slides you wish to use onto one of the HDMI displays which you can select from the HDMI matrix. It is best to use one of the monitors in front of the camera for your slides. Drag the slides to the display you wish to use. • With your slides, ensure these have a black background to prevent any issues with contrast in the recording. As a general guide, it is best to use slides in the style of the ODL slide template. An example set of slides is available on the desktop of the BOLD account. Open the screen capture recording app which you can find in the dock as shown below Figure 2.8: App for screen capture Once opened, you will see a dialogue box open in your active window stating “Record from the screen showing the other dialog?” as shown below. You will then see an additional dialogue open on one of the other open screens reading “This screen will be recorded”. If the screen you wish to record does not show the second dialogue box, press “Swap” on the first dialogue box which will switch screen recording to the other screen. Select “Record” once the second dialogue box is on the screen you wish to record. Figure 2.9: Commands for selecting screen to capture You will then be asked to specify a location to save your screen capture. Set the folder to your own specified folder. Ensure you keep the .mp4 file type in the name, else the video will not record! Another dialogue box should appear which will ask you “Stop video recording?”. Leave this for now while you are recording your video. Figure 2.10: Stop recording action window Press the record button (red button) on the camera to start recording from the camera. You should see a red light appear on the camera. An additional window will open called “Gstreamer video output” Place this on an additional screen (usually on one of the monitors in front of the camera). This display allows you to see yourself with the screen recording of the slides/output so you can position yourself correctly throughout the recording. Figure 2.11: GStreamer output Use the clicker to change slides through your recording (be sure to make sure this window is selected first). Once you have completed your recording, stop recording on the camera and then press “Stop” on the dialogue box on the Mac. Do NOT press “Kill” as this will terminate the process and the recording will not be saved! You will now see your screen capture recording saved as an mp4 file in your specified location. To import the camera capture, switch off the camera and remove the SD card from the port. Insert the SD card into the D-link port at the back of the Mac. You will be able to find your recording in the Canon drive in the Locations tab in Finder. The files should be chronologically ordered, so scroll to the bottom to find your recording. Figure 2.12: File location for SD card recordings "],["using-the-light-board.html", "2.4 Using the light board", " 2.4 Using the light board Prior to using the light board, make sure it is clean with no visible streaks as this will show up in the recording. There is spray and cloths by the black curtain which you can use to clean the light board. If you are referring to points on a slide, you may find it useful to use control points to mark areas to point to when presenting. The green string frame around the light board indicates areas where not to write when presenting. Be sure to write within this frame so it is picked up by the recording. Figure 2.13: Light board recording area (within green frame) There are pens to use specifically for the light board. These sometimes need to be primed so press back and forth on the tip for a minute to ensure the ink has filled the tip. If all of the pens run dry, let the ODL management team know so more can be ordered.

Figure 3.5: Final Cut timeline Ensure that the screen capture video is at the top of the display and the camera recording is at the bottom on the timeline. Firstly, you will need to combine the screen capture and camera recording together. This can be done by heading to the top left corner of the Final Cut interface, selecting the Film icon, then selecting All in Blend Mode. Figure 3.6: Setting Blend Mode Next, highlight the camera recording only on the timeline and change Scale x to -100%. You can enter the numbers here by double clicking. This will flip the camera recording image. Figure 3.7: Changing Scale x to flip video With the camera recording still selected, now select the Audio menu in the top left corner (denoted by the speaker icon) and set the audio configuration to Dual Mono. Figure 3.8: Changing audio to Dual Mono Next, match up your camera output and screen capture so they are in sync. You can do this by dragging the camera output file to align with the audio of the screen capture. You can use the soundwaves underneath the videos to help matching this. You can zoom in with the editor to make this easier using Command + (and Command - to zoom out again). Finally, mute the sound on the screen capture video. You can do this by selecting the horizontal line on the video file in the timeline, above the sound file. Hold the left mouse button and drag down to mute. Figure 3.9: Muting screen capture file "],["editing-the-video.html", "3.4 Editing the video", " 3.4 Editing the video You may wish to add an introductory slide screen prior to your video beginning (like videos produced in ODL). The easiest way to do this is to take a screenshot of such a slide in full screen mode. You can do this by using Shift &gt; Command &gt; 3 which will save this to the desktop. Simply drag and drop the screen capture to your recording pane on Final Cut or use the Import command. To transition between recordings, there is an option to include transitions. The most common type to use is “Blurs” and then “Simple”, though do feel free to use any transitions you wish! Simply select and drag your chosen transition and place this between two video files for the transition to be included. You can alter the length of the transition by highlighting the edges of the transition window and dragging to increase/decrease the length. You can also add a transition using the hotkey shortcut Command + T Figure 3.10: Selecting transitions menu Figure 3.11: Transition options Figure 3.12: Controlling the time length of a transition You can adjust the position and size of the speaker in your camera recording by highlighting the camera recording track and selecting the bottom left panel on the recording viewer.
