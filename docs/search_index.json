This will be used to select the desired displays from the monitors within the room. All monitors are labelled from A to D with an indication as to what output is being shown. There is also a remote control which can change outputs should you wish to use this when recording. Figure 2.1: HDMI Matrix with instructions on channel connections Pull down the black curtain if you are recording. A yellow pulley is adjacent to the left-side wall which will lower the curtain. Figure 2.2: Pulley for curtain Switch on all of the lights here for recording. The switches for these are marked at the sockets around the room and shown below. Switch on the lightboard lights also if you intend to use this. The main room lights can be switched off (and will do automatically within 10 minutes as they are on a timer). Some of the lights are movable and feel free to adjust these as you wish for your recording. Figure 2.3: Sockets for light switches to be used for recording "],["preparing-the-recording-equipment.html", "2.2 Preparing the recording equipment", " 2.2 Preparing the recording equipment Switch on the Mac (ensure mouse and keyboard are also switched on). Log in using the BOLD account (password – glasgow). Switch on the camera for recording. Ensure the SD card is inserted prior to recording. The SD card can be accessed at the bottom of the camera. Figure 2.4: Camera setup for recording Ensure there is enough space on the SD card before you begin to record. You can check this by inserting the SD card into the D-link port behind the Mac. Figure 2.5: D-link port to connect SD card Switch on microphone pack. When wearing the pack, it is best to clip this on your side facing up, hiding the cable inside your top and attaching the mic to your collar. Also switch on the remote pack beside the camera. You can test that this is working by looking at the display and seeing the volume going up and down on the camera. Figure 2.6: Microphone pack for recording with camera pack If neither pack is switching on, replace the batteries for these using the rechargeable batteries near the Mac. Be sure to charge any flat batteries. There are spare charged batteries in the cabinet in the right corner behind the Mac. Figure 2.7: Battery charger Switch on the monitors. There is one Samsung remote which can be used to switch on all of the displays. Keep the remote close to the front of the display when switching on so this is picked up by the receiver. "],["setting-up-the-mac-for-screen-capture-recording.html", "2.3 Setting up the Mac for screen capture recording", " 2.3 Setting up the Mac for screen capture recording NB - if you are recording without slides or are using only the light board, skip this step for your recording When you are recording with interacting slides or programming output (e.g. R), you will record two videos One from the camera with yourself and the light board One with a screen recording of the slides/programming output The camera output will be recorded on the SD card with the screen capture saved locally. If you are just recording yourself with no slides or using the whiteboard, you can skip the following steps and record directly off the camera. To set up the second recording with the screen capture, first prepare your slides you wish to use onto one of the HDMI displays which you can select from the HDMI matrix. It is best to use one of the monitors in front of the camera for your slides. Drag the slides to the display you wish to use. • With your slides, ensure these have a black background to prevent any issues with contrast in the recording. As a general guide, it is best to use slides in the style of the ODL slide template. An example set of slides is available on the desktop of the BOLD account. Open the screen capture recording app which you can find in the dock as shown below Figure 2.8: App for screen capture Once opened, you will see a dialogue box open in your active window stating “Record from the screen showing the other dialog?” as shown below. You will then see an additional dialogue open on one of the other open screens reading “This screen will be recorded”. If the screen you wish to record does not show the second dialogue box, press “Swap” on the first dialogue box which will switch screen recording to the other screen. Select “Record” once the second dialogue box is on the screen you wish to record. Figure 2.9: Commands for selecting screen to capture You will then be asked to specify a location to save your screen capture. Set the folder to your own specified folder. Ensure you keep the .mp4 file type in the name, else the video will not record! Another dialogue box should appear which will ask you “Stop video recording?”. Leave this for now while you are recording your video. Figure 2.10: Stop recording action window Press the record button (red button) on the camera to start recording from the camera. You should see a red light appear on the camera. An additional window will open called “Gstreamer video output” Place this on an additional screen (usually on one of the monitors in front of the camera). This display allows you to see yourself with the screen recording of the slides/output so you can position yourself correctly throughout the recording. Figure 2.11: GStreamer output Use the clicker to change slides through your recording (be sure to make sure this window is selected first). Once you have completed your recording, stop recording on the camera and then press “Stop” on the dialogue box on the Mac. Do NOT press “Kill” as this will terminate the process and the recording will not be saved! You will now see your screen capture recording saved as an mp4 file in your specified location. To import the camera capture, switch off the camera and remove the SD card from the port. Insert the SD card into the D-link port at the back of the Mac. You will be able to find your recording in the Canon drive in the Locations tab in Finder. The files should be chronologically ordered, so scroll to the bottom to find your recording. Figure 2.12: File location for SD card recordings "],["using-the-light-board.html", "2.4 Using the light board", " 2.4 Using the light board Prior to using the light board, make sure it is clean with no visible streaks as this will show up in the recording. There is spray and cloths by the black curtain which you can use to clean the light board. If you are referring to points on a slide, you may find it useful to use control points to mark areas to point to when presenting. The green string frame around the light board indicates areas where not to write when presenting. Be sure to write within this frame so it is picked up by the recording. Figure 2.13: Light board recording area (within green frame) There are pens to use specifically for the light board. These sometimes need to be primed so press back and forth on the tip for a minute to ensure the ink has filled the tip. If all of the pens run dry, let the ODL management team know so more can be ordered.

Figure 2.15: LaCie drive for file storage "],["finishing-up.html", "2.6 Finishing up", " 2.6 Finishing up Once you are finished, check the battery level on the microphones. If these are low, please change these with new batteries and charge those removed. Shut down the Mac and place the keyboard/mouse on charge with the charging cable underneath the Mac. Put main lights on in room and turn off all other lights including lightboard. Ensure camera is switched off. Turn off HDMI matrix. Make sure all monitors are switched off.
